  <h3>Symbol Project</h3>

        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Designing a symbol will not only keep the tension around and inside the design but,
          when minimized the negative space is still displayed alike the larger format.
          The project allowed me to take appropriate steps into consideration of what works
          for the design process in making a logo from, using basic shapes to creating a
          finalized version.</p>

  <h3>Symbol Process</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/web2.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>This excercise was to create a symbol that not only dealt with the principle of
          tension but, how minimal a design can be without losing the information to the client.
          I learned that if you create one version, you can understand how many contrasting
          versions you can choose from to get to the finalized version.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Connections project was challenging since I couldn’t use type, except for the tiltle,
           I took the challenge in creating a visual that displayed minimal information to get
           the viewer to guess what the message means. One aspect of design I’ve taken was to
           eliminate useless information/imagery, that way the audience has enough visuals to
           create a judgement.
          <br></br>
           I created a visual that is related to music and how different music creates contrasting
           wavelengths or vibrations when seen visually. </p>

<div id="h-composition" class="fullproject">
  <h3>H Composition</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/web4.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The process in creating a lettform was interesting, it brought about new notions of how
          letterform and type is made and how a family can be created from using contrasting weight.
          I learned how to train my eye into looking at the space above and below the crossbar of
          the ‘H’. The space above the crossbar is actually higher, you can tell when the ‘H’ is
          flipped upside down. </p>
</div>



<div id="h-45degrees" class="fullproject">
    <h3>H 45 Degrees</h3>
       <div class="fullimage">
            <img src="images/web5.jpg"/>
          </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The final version made me experience the different paths to get a perspective at the
            tension space within the ‘H’. The one principle that stood out was composition, not only
            does your mind see the letterform but, from a distance you see a design as a whole.
            You start to see more of a pattern than the letter itself. </p>
</div>


<div id="h-90degrees" class="fullproject">
  <h3>H 90 Degrees</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/web6.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>This project guided me to look at the areas surrounding the bled off ‘H’s’. My design helped
           me determine a pattern with contrasting weights to control the layout a bit differently.
           I learned that some weights are heavier than most so it’s good to keep some that are similar
           in shape apart from each other. I gained knowledge of layout design and where to position awkward
           images/objects within the composition.</p>

<div id="plp-dots" class="fullproject">
  <h3>PLP Dots</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/web7.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>One principle defined within this project is tension, tension is the space surrounding the image/object.
          Establishing  equal tension can make the design seem more symmetrical or asymmetrical. Generating a
          rhythm or pattern allows the dots to create tension within and around the surrounding and bleeding dots.
          The design gives the audience a chance to connect the sequences but, each dot is unexpected preeceding
          the following. </p>
</div>


<div id="plp-lines" class="fullproject">
  <h3>PLP Lines</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/web8.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The process helped me develop a notion to create unexpected sequences using both vertical and horizontal
           lines of contrasting widths. Within the 5” x 5” format the heavy weighted lines were a bit more extreme
           which tended to be the focal point and captures the viwers eyes in the middle of the composition.
           I created a design that will encapture the viewer to look at the sequence from an uncomfortable angle.</p>

<div id="cube" class="fullproject">
  <h3>Cube</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/cubetemplate.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Using the points concept from the point-line-plane (PLP Dots) banner, I translated the concept of the design onto a
        different medium which not only has one but six sides. Allowing the design to wrap the form
        gives it a sene of direction, motion and interesting dynamics. Examining the shape at a three dimensional perspective
         gives your eyes to gather more information when it's interactive with all the eight cubes, sided with the large cube.

  <h3>Poster</h3>
     <div class="fullimage">
          <img src="images/finalreviewposter_image.jpg"/>
        </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Creating the final review poster gave me the opportunity to experiment with color and arrangment of type. The composition of the
           image created a dynamic balance and equal tension among the whole piece. Creating hierarchy among the type came easiest
           since there was enough negative space within the image to input. replacing the black and white composition with color
            gave a new meaning to the poster, it brought about a sense of attention and created enough eye room for the viewer.</p>
